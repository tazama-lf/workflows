## GitHub Action Workflow Documentation: tfsec

#### Purpose

- This GitHub Action workflow is designed to run tfsec, a security scanner for Terraform code, on specified branches, pull requests, and a scheduled basis. It generates a SARIF report (a standard format for security issues) and uploads it to GitHub.

- This workflow automates security scanning of Terraform code using tfsec. It runs on pushes to the dev and main branches, on pull requests targeting dev, and on a scheduled basis. 

- The SARIF report generated by tfsec is uploaded to GitHub, enabling security issues to be tracked and managed directly within the GitHub repository.

#### Trigger Events

`push`:

`branches`: [ "dev", "main" ] - The workflow triggers when code is pushed to the dev or main branches.

`pull_request`:

`branches`: [ "dev" ] - The workflow triggers when a pull request is opened or updated against the dev branch.

`schedule`:

`cron`: '31 11 * * 1' - The workflow runs every Monday at 11:31 AM UTC, ensuring regular scans even if no code changes occur.

- runs-on: ubuntu-latest - The job runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.

#### permissions:

`actions: read` - Grants read access to the actions in the repository.

`contents: read` - Grants read access to the repository contents.

`security-events: write` - Grants write access to security events, which is necessary to upload the SARIF report.

#### Workflow Steps

- Clone Repository

- Run tfsec

- Upload SARIF file

sarif_file: tfsec.sarif - This specifies the path to the SARIF file that will be uploaded to GitHub's security tab for analysis.
